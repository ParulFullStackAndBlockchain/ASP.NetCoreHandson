    @*What is _ViewStart.cshtml file in ASP.NET Core MVC

    It's a special file in ASP.NET Core MVC. The code in this file is executed before the code in an individual view is executed.
    So this means, instead of setting the Layout property in each individual view, we can move that code into the
    _ViewStart.cshtml file.*@

    @*Logic to select layout view
    In an ASP.NET Core MVC application, we can have multiple layout views. Let's say for example, we have the following 
    2 layout views in our application. 
    _AdminLayout.cshtml
    _NonAdminLayout.cshtml
    The following logic in _ViewStart.cshtml will select the layout view spending on the logged-in user role.

    @{
        if (User.IsInRole("Admin"))
        {
            Layout = "_AdminLayout";
        }
        else
        {
            Layout = "_NonAdminLayout";
        }
    }*@
