@using EmployeeManagement.Models;
@using EmployeeManagement.ViewModels;

@*@using directive is used to include the common namespaces. In addition to @using directive, _ViewImports file also supports
     the following directives.
    @addTagHelper
    @removeTagHelper
    @tagHelperPrefix
    @model
    @inherits
    @inject*@
@*Just like, _ViewStart file, _ViewImports file is also hierarchical. In addition to placing it in the Views folder, we can also
      place another _ViewImports in the "Home" sub-folder in the Views folder.
    The settings specified in the _ViewImports file in the Home sub-folder overwrites the settings specified in the
      _ViewImports file in the Views folder.
    Note : If a setting is specified in the view itself, then that setting overrides the matching settings in the parent 
    _ViewImports files in the folder hierarchy.*@
