    _ViewStart.cshtml file is hierarchical
    We usually place the ViewStart file in the Views folder. Since this file is hierarchical we can also place it in any sub-folder
    in the Views folder.

    In our case we have placed one ViewStart file in the Views folder and another ViewStart file in the Home sub-folder. 
    The layout page specified in the ViewStart file in the Home sub-folder overwrites the layout page specified in the 
    ViewStart file in the Views folder.
    This means, all the views in the Views folder will use the the layout page specified in the ViewStart file in the Views, 
    but then the views in the Home folder will use the layout page specified in the ViewStart file in the Home folder.   *@
