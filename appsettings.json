//Note : If there are certain settings that you want your asp.net core application to use when you publish and deploy your app,
//store them in appsettings.json file. We usually store our application configuration settings in this file. 

//We can also have environment specific appsettings.json files. For example, appsettings.Staging.json for the staging environment.

//In ASP.NET Core, in addition to appsettings.json file, we also have other configuration sources like Environment variables, 
//User Secrets, Command Line Arguments and even our own custom configuration source.
